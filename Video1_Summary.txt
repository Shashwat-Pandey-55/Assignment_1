In the first video, I start at the very beginning of Python's learning process.
The topics included lists (or arrays), variables, strings, and control statements.
Being familiar with other, less beginner-friendly languages like C and Java helped me breeze through the learning process.
Python's adaptability and simplicity in data management impressed me.
Libraries reduced complexity in the coding process by removing the need to start from scratch.
This was demonstrated in the first project, which utilised libraries to make Excel file data manipulation a breeze.
The machine learning project also included ready-made features to cut down on development time.
Since I'm more familiar with standard HTML, CSS, and JS, the Django project presented a greater challenge. However, I'm positive that
I'll soon feel comfortable working in the framework.
