In the initial video, I learned Python right from the beginning.
It covered variables, strings, control statements, and lists (or arrays).
The learning process was smooth for me, given my experience with less beginner-friendly languages like C and Java.
I was surprised by Python's versatility and its ease of handling data.
The availability of libraries further simplified coding, eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel.
The first project involved manipulating data in an Excel file, which was made simple with the help of libraries.
Similarly, the machine learning project provided pre-implemented functions for ease of use.
The Django project posed a greater challenge, as I have prior experience with plain HTML, CSS, and JS, but with practice, I'm confident it will become easier to grasp.
