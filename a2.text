Medical prescriptions and other information are stored electronically by doctors, patients, and others.
This research proposes an AI-assisted blockchain-based system to store and process medical records utilising AI techniques like OCR
to create a single patient medical history report. For ease of use and storage on a decentralised blockchain network,
this report delivers only the essential information. 5G networks are intended to fix 4G network difficulties, while blockchain technology
can retain persistent and transparent data logs. 5G connection, artificial intelligence, and blockchain can help electronic medical record
(EMR) systems save billions of dollars annually.

This essay emphasises that a systematic patient history is the most significant diagnostic factor. A survey found that over 50% of
physicians considered patient history the most important diagnostic factor. Ambivalent and confusing information can lead to medication
repeat and accidental neglect of crucial facts. Due to uncertain diagnosis, doctors may refuse emergency cases and redirect them to other
institutions.
EMR systems improve data storage and retrieval. Unlike non-digital systems, it draws and maintains patient information digitally and can
replace or supplement healthcare data storage. EMRs are growing more popular, yet they are expensive and difficult to implement.
A blockchain-based medical record management system and machine learning and deep learning image analysis models have been suggested and 
explored. Data disclosure remains a concern for the system.

The suggested network model architecture, which includes a web front-end, IPFS file storage, blockchain storage, and machine learning model
processing, is the most important part of this book. The user-friendly front-end platform presents the case concisely. 
The network model has four parts: a web front-end, IPFS file storage, blockchain storage, and machine learning model processing. 
The Ethereum React Truffle box builds decentralised apps. SimpleStorage.sol stores the IPFS reference (hash) on the blockchain.

Rescaling, shadow removal, noise reduction, and binarization are used to optimise images. The image is binarized to improve results.
This study describes a 5G-based Ethereum blockchain and IPFS dApp for patient document storage and maintenance. 
The AI-powered Tesseract OCR Engine reads handwritten prescriptions. Microsoft Azure Computer Vision Cognitive Service API does picture OCR
analysis.

Blockchains store IPFS hashes to reduce expenses. Type 1 and Type 3 documents undergo several preprocessing filters before being processed
by the AI-based Tesseract OCR. Preprocessing photos improves model performance 4.698%. Optimised decentralisation ensures security without
sacrificing patient identity.
