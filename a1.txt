The international community is adopting AI technology to exploit electronic medical record (EMR) data to increase medical big data use. 
By categorising patient features, AI can anticipate illness occurrence or provide personalised treatment.
Standardising and refining EMR data improves AI research. To protect the patient's privacy, and to improve EMR quality,
AI is needed to collate EMR data.

Korean researchers want to structure and standardise medical data for clinical application. 
EMR data quality and collection must be managed to maximise clinical use-value. AI algorithm development involves medical and analysis 
expertise, data preprocessing technology, and structured, high-quality EMR data. Structured, semi-structured,
and unstructured EMR data exist.

Semi-structured data can be altered, while structured data are predetermined. Unstructured data are irregularly shaped and
hard to characterise. Image data can be quickly collected because data quality management is not needed.
AI improves hospital operations, patient management, and treatment. Big data platforms and biohealth R&D expenditures are planned in Korea.

An ECG-validated deep-learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DLA) predicted cardiac arrest in one research. 
Medical data research should be ethical and legal. Data standardisation, domain knowledge enhancements, and privacy are crucial.
Linking and integrating big data from other institutions is doable, but hospitals should discussbeforehand. 
Read the "Guideline for Pseudonymization" or "Guideline for Utilisation of Healthcare Data" beforehand.
