In this course of Linux Shell Scripting, i learnt about shell, different commands used to operate shell file, what all commands we need to 
use to operate the file on terminal, how to remove script and many more.
A shell script is a text file that contains a series of commands. I came to know that any work you can do on the command line can be automated
via shell script. Before we can execute the file as a script, we need to give execution permissions. To give execution permissions we use 
the command -> chmod +x file_name.sh
And to execute the file we use ./file_name.sh
To remove the script we use the command -> rm file_name.sh
If we donot use the chmod command we get the promt = permission denied. We use the command ls -l file_name.sh to see what all permissions the
file_name.sh has. In order to execute the script file we need to have both read and execute permission on that file.
#!/bin/bash --> SHEBANG = determines what program executes the command listed in the file.
I also learnt that echo is a shell built in command (part of bash). We use type command to check whether a command is shellbuilt in or not.
Then i learnt about various kinds of methods by which we can declare variables and many errors we commit while using them.
Mostly we use upper case letters as variables. It is by convention and not by syntax. 
For declaring comments we use # and then write lines explaining the code.
To get root user previliges we use the command -> sudo ./got-root.sh
Root USER ID in linux is 0. To exit the root account we use the command -> exit
I also learnt about conditionals (if else) in this course.
This course was great in terms of knowledge and compactness.
